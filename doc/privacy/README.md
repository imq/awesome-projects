## Social Networks and Platforms

> Note: Alternative clients will share your IP with the service as they make direct requests.

### Alternative Frontends

Alternative frontends are good to protect your individual privacy. You can still consume the contents of privative and privacy-harmful services with protection over your privacy and some anonimity. Even using most these alternative frontends, still, the privative services will receive requests about the content you are consuming (even not knowing it is you). This sitll harms the collective privacy and adds data to their algorithms in some ways.

You can use these tools to automatically redirect any links to privacy-respecting alternative frontends:

- [Farside](https://github.com/benbusby/farside) - A smart redirecting gateway for various frontend services.
- [LibRedirect](https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect#get) - A web extension that redirects YouTube, Twitter, Instagram... requests to alternative privacy friendly frontends and backends.
- [UntrackMe](https://www.f-droid.org/en/packages/app.fedilab.nitterizeme/) - Transform Youtube, Twitter & Instagram links to their free and open source alternatives.

### Instagram

[![](https://shields.tosdr.org/en_219.svg)](https://tosdr.org/en/service/219)

<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> Don't use Instagram (or at least the official client). Instagram is a very privacy-invasive app with biased results and feeds based on user profiles, it is also used as a manipulation tool and has a lot of censorship going against free speech. Lastly, it has an addictive and toxic UI design.

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img> **Instead use**

**Alternatives to Instagram**
- [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) - Decentralized, federated and Open Source alternative to Instagram with posts, videos, stories, tags, etc.

### YouTube

<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> Don't use YouTube (or at least the official client). YouTube is very privacy invasive, it generates a very accurate profile based on your interests.

It never shows you [alternative opinions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) to your ideology/bias. YouTube censors a lot. YouTube collects a LOT of your data: interests, free time, ideology, likes, dislikes, music taste, etc.

- [Free VPNs](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/free-vpn-bad-for-privacy/) from Google Play or any appstore. These services are not free as they will suck your connections data, keep logs and profile you to [sell your data to advertisers](https://thenextweb.com/news/be-cautious-free-vpns-are-selling-your-data-to-3rd-parties). If a govenrment wants to track someone, such apps will be the first ones to fall.

- Closed source VPN apps such as Surfshark or NordVPN may be less trustworthy as nobody can be sure how they handle your data. Also, paying with Credit Card will get you identified on the payment. Furthermore, if you need to give your email it will also identify you if this same email has been used in other services.


<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img>  **Instead use**

Here are some open source and truly private (no personal data and/or credit card needed) options:
