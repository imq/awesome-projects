### Minecraft

[![](https://shields.tosdr.org/en_244.svg)](https://tosdr.org/en/service/244)

The game is owned by Microsoft. If this is not enough, you need a Microsoft account to play Minecraft since March 11th, 2022. Microsoft locks accounts some time not long after account creation and [forces the user](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/issues/4093) [to provide](https://libreddit.kavin.rocks/r/privacy/comments/e6x27o/microsoft_forcing_me_to_give_then_my_phone_number/) a **phone number**. See: [Minecraft FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Account-Migration-FAQ), [1](https://libreddit.kavin.rocks/r/Minecraft/comments/sl8pkv/how_can_my_friend_migrate_her_account_to/hvq2sv6/), [2](https://libreddit.kavin.rocks/r/privacy/comments/spcuj4/microsoft_is_going_to_attempt_to_move_everyone_on/)

The game has [telemetry embeded in it since v21w38a which you can't opt-out](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-237493). Also, [it is tied](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/terms) to the [Microsoft privacy terms](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement) which are a privacy nightmare.

#### Plugins for Minecraft

- [No-Telemetry](https://github.com/kb-1000/no-telemetry) - Mod that disables the usage data collection, aka telemetry, introduced in Minecraft 1.18 (snapshot 21w38a).
- [No-Chat-Reports](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports) - Strips cryptographic signatures from player messages, making it impossible to track and associate them with your Mojang/Microsoft account.

<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img> **Instead use**

> **Note on Android app compatibility**: Although all of these Operating Systems are Android, app compatibility may not be perfect due to a lack of GMS (Google Mobile Services) which some apps require. You can check how well apps work with microg (a free and open source alternative to GMS) or no GMS at all with [Plexus](https://plexus.techlore.tech/) where the community can report how well android apps perform in those environments.

> **Note on Android security**: Custom ROMs can improve your privacy the same as they can decrease the Android security, always use ROMs that support verified boot and encryption and **DO NOT** have root enabled by default. If possible, don't use userdebug builds. If your threat model requires security, buy a Google Pixel and install GrapheneOS on it. [Read more on PrivacyGuides](https://www.privacyguides.org/android/overview/).

## Social Networks and Platforms

> **NOTE: The fediverse**
>
> The fediverse is a "**fed**erated" "un**iverse**" of social network platforms that are able to talk to one another through a standard and open protocol. This means that you can consume content on any network from any of these networks. You are not locked to a single provider, you are free to choose. Please [watch this video](https://framatube.org/w/9dRFC6Ya11NCVeYKn8ZhiD?start=8s) by FramaSoft that illustrates the concept very good.
>
> Ideally, we should all move to the fediverse and abandon the centralized and monopolized social networks that are now the most popular (Twitter, Reddit, Instagram...).
>
> All the apps compatible with the Fediverse (ActivityPub) are marked with a 🧩

> **NOTE: About alternative frontends and clients**
>
> Alternative frontends are good to protect your individual privacy. You can still consume the contents of privative and privacy-harmful services with protection over your privacy and some anonimity. Even using most these alternative frontends, still, the privative services will receive requests about the content you are consuming (even not knowing it is you). This sitll harms the collective privacy and adds data to their algorithms in some ways. Only the alternative frontends (or clients) that act as a proxy will hide your real IP from the content provider. 
>
> You can use these browser extensions and apps to automatically redirect any links to privacy-respecting alternative frontends:
> - [Farside](https://github.com/benbusby/farside) - A smart redirecting gateway for various frontend services.
> - [LibRedirect](https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect#get) - A web extension that redirects YouTube, Twitter... requests to alternative privacy friendly frontends and backends.

<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> Don't use Instagram (or at least the official client). Instagram is a very privacy-invasive app with biased results and feeds based on user profiles, it is also used as a manipulation tool and has a lot of censorship going against free speech. Lastly, it has an addictive and toxic UI design.

It never shows you [alternative opinions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) to your ideology/bias. YouTube censors a lot. YouTube collects a LOT of your data: interests, free time, ideology, likes, dislikes, music taste, etc.

[![](https://shields.tosdr.org/en_1448.svg)](https://tosdr.org/en/service/1448)

<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> Avoid using TikTok, it is a toxic-designed application that harms not only the user privacy but also user integrity. You can take a read on [these several posts](https://libreddit.kavin.rocks/r/privacy/search?q=tiktok&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all).

## VPNs
<img width="16" src="misc/forbidden.png"> </img> **Avoid**

- [Free VPNs](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/free-vpn-bad-for-privacy/) from Google Play or any appstore. These services are not free as they will suck your connections' data, keep logs and profile you to [sell your data to advertisers](https://thenextweb.com/news/be-cautious-free-vpns-are-selling-your-data-to-3rd-parties). If a government wants to track someone, such apps will be the first ones to fall.

- Closed source VPN apps such as Surfshark or NordVPN may be less trustworthy as nobody can be sure how they handle your data. Also, paying with Credit Card will get you identified on the payment. Furthermore, if you need to give your email it will also identify you if this same email has been used in other services.


<img width="16" src="misc/check.png"> </img>  **Instead use**

Here are some open source and truly private (no personal data and/or credit card needed) options:

- **Microsoft Edge** - It's a Microsoft-themed version of Chromium with Microsoft trackers instead of Google ones. Under [Microsoft's privacy policy](https://tosdr.org/en/service/244), which is also very bad.

## Privacy vs Security vs Anonimity

Anonymity, Privacy, and Security are often used interchangeably, but they actually represent distinct concepts. It is important to understand the differences between them.

- Privacy is about regulating who has access to your personal information, being aware of the data that is being collected about you, and having the ability to decide who can access it and how. In short, privacy involves controlling your personal information.

- Security refers to safeguarding your personal information from unauthorized access or theft. It involves ensuring that your data is protected and stored in a secure manner, making it difficult for malicious actors to access it.

- Anonymity is about ensuring that your actions cannot be traced back to you. This means that even if someone discovers what you are doing, they will not be able to identify you as the source.

It is important to note that privacy and security are not necessarily interdependent. For instance, Google systems are secure and unlikely to be hacked, but Google still has access to your personal data and makes use of it. 

Privacy and anonimity are also not necessarily linked, services like Signal offer high levels of privacy since they do not collect any data about what you say, who you talk to or how you use the app, but they may not be anonymous since you still need to register using your phone number (which is in many cases linked to your identity).

Finally, there are services that may offer all three: anonymity, privacy, and security. The primary focus of this list is to provide alternatives that prioritize privacy. These alternatives give you control over your data and do not collect or sell it.
