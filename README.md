# The list 

This is more like aggregation of lists of services that are now popular. At this moment is still WIP, so things can change. 


This list is the result of Pull Requests, reviews, ideas and work done by the people for the people. 
You too can help by sending PR to add more services or by remove ones that changed or been retired.
