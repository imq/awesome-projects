# The list 

This is more like aggregation of lists of services that are now popular. At this moment is still WIP, so things can change. 


I did this list to have all under one roof, basically I've found pretty hard to search for something in so many repos. 
Hope that I can manage to keep it clean, for now it is setup a python script to pipes some repositories and creates / updates this one.


[Penetration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test) is the practice of launching authorized, simulated attacks against computer systems and their physical infrastructure to expose potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Should you discover a vulnerability, please follow [this guidance](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/guidance/) to report it responsibly.

Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) teams are groups of people in an organization responsible for managing the response to a security incident, including gathering evidence of the incident, remediating its effects, and implementing controls to prevent the incident from recurring in the future.
